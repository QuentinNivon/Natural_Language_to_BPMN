Employee Onboarding Upon receiving a new employees signed contract, the HR department initiates the onboarding process (InitiateOnboarding). This includes setting up an email account (SetUpEmail), granting access to necessary software systems (GrantAccess), and scheduling an induction session with the team leader (ScheduleInduction). The process is completed once the new employee has attended the induction session and acknowledges understanding their role and responsibilities (CompleteOnboarding).
