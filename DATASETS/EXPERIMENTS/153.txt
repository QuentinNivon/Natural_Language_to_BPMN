The first step is to DetermineContactDetails of potential customers.
This can be achieved in several ways.
Sometimes, we BuyDetailsForColdCalls, sometimes our marketing staff ParticipateInExhibitions, and sometimes you just CallSomebodyInterested.
Then, the call center staff DetermineContractPerson and AllocateBudget.
Of course they also AskCustomerForInterest.
If the customer is not interested, they either LeaveCustomerAlone or TryToInterest customer.
Otherwise, the head of development personally TryToAcquireCustomer.
If the customer gets interested, he ReceiveDetailedOnlinePresentation?
Afterwards, we WaitForCustomerInfo.
If we are not contacted within two weeks, a sales representative CallCustomer.
Finally, we CreateQuotation.
