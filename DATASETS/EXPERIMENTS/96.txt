The Customer Service Representative performs SendMortgageOffer and then does WaitForCustomerReply. If the customer decline the offer, UpdateCaseDetails is done and then ArchiveWork. If the customer accepts the offer and SendBackCompletedDocuments and AttachAllPrerequisitesDocuments, MoveCaseToAdministration occurs. After the reception, if documents are missing, GenerateRequestForDocuments is initiated. If the user does not respond to the request within 2 weeks, UpdateCaseDetailsBeforeArchive is executed.
