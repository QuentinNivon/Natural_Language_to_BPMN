My process starts by LoginIntoSystem. Then you can do one of two alternatives. The first alternative is to MakeNewReservation. In this case, you would first LookForFlights for the desired dates, considering different alternatives. This process may be repeated several times using different parameters, until the right flight is selected. You end with AcceptReservation. The second alternative is to ConfirmExistingReservation. One way or another, you ConfirmReservation and then ProceedToPayment for it.
