At the beginning, the customer PerceiveServiceDegradation. A list with all the problem parameters is then SendProblemParameters to the Customer Service department of TELECO. At the customer service, an employee EnterProblemReport into system T. Then the problem report is CompareToSLA to identify the extent and details of the service degradation. Based on this, the necessary DetermineCounterMeasures including their respective priorities. An electronic service then DetermineCustomerSignificance based on information collected during the history of the contractual relationship. In case the customer is premium, the process will link to an extra problem fix process (this process will not be detailed here). In case the customer is of certain significance which would affect the counter measures previously decided upon, the process goes back to re-prioritize these measures otherwise the process continues. Taking together the information (i.e., contract commitment data + prioritized actions) a CreateDetailedProblemReport. The detailed problem report is then SendToServiceManagement. Service Management deals on a first level with violations of quality in services that are provided to customers. After receiving the detailed problem report, Service Management InvestigateProblem whether the problem is analyzable at the level of their department or whether the problem may be located at Resource Provisioning. In case Service Management assesses the problem to be not analyzable by themselves, the detailed problem report is SendToResourceProvisioning. If Service Management is sure they can analyze it, they perform the analysis and based on the outcome they CreateTroubleReport that indicates the type of problem. After Resource Provisioning receives the detailed problem report, it is checked whether there are any possible problems. If no problems are detected, a notification about the normal service execution is created. If a problem is detected, this will be analyzed by Resource Provisioning and a trouble report is created. Either trouble report or the normal execution notification will be included in a CreateStatusReport and sent back to Service Management. Service Management then PrepareFinalStatusReport based on the received information. Subsequently, it has to be DetermineCounterMeasuresFromFinalStatus depending on the information in the final status report. Three alternative process paths may be taken. For the case that no problem was detected at all, the actual SendServicePerformance back to the Customer Service. For the case that minor corrective actions are required, Service Management will UndertakeCorrectiveActions by themselves. Subsequently, the CreateProblemResolutionReport and then sent out to Customer Service. After sending, this process path of Service Management ends. For the case that automatic resource restoration from Resource Provisioning is required, Service Management must CreateRestorationRequest. This message is then sent to Resource Provisioning. Resource Provisioning has been on-hold and waiting for a restoration request but this must happen within 2 days after the status report was sent out, otherwise Resource Provisioning terminates the process. After the restoration request is received, all possible TrackErrors. Based on the tracked errors, all necessary UndertakeCorrectiveActionsByResourceProvisioning. Then a CreateTroubleShootingReport. This report is sent out to Service Management; then the process ends. The trouble-shooting report is received by Service Management and this information goes then into the creation of the problem resolution report just as described for ii). Customer Service either receives the actual service performance (if there was no problem) or the problem resolution report. Then, two concurrent activities are triggered, i.e., i) a CreateCustomerReport which details the current service performance and the resolution of the problem, and ii) a ReportToBillingAndCollections who will adjust the billing. The report for the customer is SendReportToCustomer. After all three activities are completed the process ends within Customer Service. After the customer then receives the report about service performance and problem resolution from Customer Service, the process flow at the customer also ends.
