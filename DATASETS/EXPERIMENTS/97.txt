When a claim is received, the system first CheckWhetherClaimantIsInsuredByOrganization.
Then, the system either InformClaimantOfRejection or EvaluateClaimSeverity.
Based on the outcome (simple or complex claims), it SendRelevantFormsToClaimant.
Once the forms are returned, it CheckFormsForCompleteness.
If the forms provide all relevant details, it RegisterClaim in the claims management system, which ends the claims notification process.
Otherwise, it InformClaimToUpdateForms.
Once it receives the updated forms, it CheckFormsForCompleteness again.
