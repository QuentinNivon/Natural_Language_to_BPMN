Expense Reimbursement An employee submits an expense report via the internal portal (SubmitExpenseReport). The report is automatically forwarded to their manager for approval (ManagerApproval). Upon approval, the finance department processes the payment (ProcessPayment), and the employee is notified when the reimbursement has been made (NotifyEmployee). If the manager rejects the expense report, the employee is asked to provide additional documentation or clarification (RequestAdditionalDocumentation).
