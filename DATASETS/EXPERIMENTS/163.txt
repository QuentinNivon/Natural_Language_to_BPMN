When I DetectANumberOfPersonnelRequirements, I ReportVacancyToPersonnelDepartment.
Then, I WaitForJobDescription before AdvertizingJob.
Depending of the circumstances, I either AskForCorrections or I ApproveJobDescription.
Sometimes, it also happens that the colleague from the human resources still AskQuestionsAboutTasksAndRequirements before DescribeJob.
Then, I am available for ClarifyDescription, of course.
