When a vacancy is reported to me, I CreateJobDescription from the information.
Sometimes, there is still confusion in the message, then I must AskDepartmentAgain.
I then SubmitJobForConsideration and WaitForApproval.
But it can also happen that the department RejectJobDescription and RequestCorrection.
In this case, I CorrectJobDescription and SubmitJobForConsideration again.
If the description if finally approved, I PostJob.
