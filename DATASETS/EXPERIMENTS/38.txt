The process is initiated by InitiateSwitchOverRequest.
Then, the customer TransmitCustomerData to the customer service department of the company.
The customer service ReceiveCustomerData and EnterCustomerDataIntoCRM.
After customer data has been entered, it CompareCustomerData and CheckForCompletenessAndPlausibility.
If there are errors, the customer must CorrectErrors.
If the customer does not exist in the customer database, the system will CreateNewCustomerObject.
The customer object is then used to GenerateContractDocuments for the power supplier switch.
In the following, the system performs AutomatedCheckOfContractDocuments within the CIS to confirm their successful generation.
If there is a negative response, the system AnalyzeAndResolveIssues and GenerateContractDocuments again.
If there is a positive response, the system SendConfirmationToCustomer stating that the switch-over to the new supplier can be executed.
The cis then SendRequestToGridOperator to check if the customer may be supplied by the selected supplier in the future. The grid operator then CheckSwitchOverRequest for supplier concurrence, and TransmitResponseComment.
If there is supplier concurrence, the grid operator InformSuppliers, DemandeConflictResolution and TerminateOldSalesAgreement between the customer and the old supplier.
If there are no objections by the grid operator, the customer service CreateCISContract.
After that, the customer can CheckContractDetails and may decide to either WithdrawFromSwitchContract or ConfirmSwitchContract.
Finally, the grid operator TransmitPowerMeterData to the customer service and the old supplier via messages containing a services consumption report.
At the same time, the grid operator ComputeFinalBilling based on the meter data and SendFinalBillingToCustomer.
