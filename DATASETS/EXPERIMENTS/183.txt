Product Development Lifecycle The process begins with the marketing team submitting a product concept(SubmitProductConcept). The concept is reviewed by the product development team (ReviewConcept), which assesses feasibility and outlines the necessary resources (AssessFeasibility). Upon approval, the project enters the design phase (EnterDesignPhase), followed by development (Development), testing (Testing), and finally, launch (LaunchProduct). Post-launch, the product is reviewed for any necessary improvements or iterations (Post-LaunchReview).
