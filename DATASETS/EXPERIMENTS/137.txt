The process starts when any employee of the organization SubmitsOfficeSupplyRequest.
Once the requirement is registered, the immediate supervisor of the employee requesting the office supplies ReceiveRequest.
Then, he either Approve, AskForChange, or RejectRequest.
If the request is rejected, the process will end.
If the request is asked for a change, the employee can ReviewComments, MakeChanges and eventually SubmitsOfficeSupplyRequest again.
If the request is approved, the purchase department will MakeQuotations (using a subprocess) and SelectVendor.
If the vendor is not valid in the system, the purchase department will SelectVendor again.
After a vendor is selected and confirmed, the system will GenerateAndSendPurchaseOrder, WaitForProductDelivery and WaitForInvoice.
After that, the system will SendNotification to the user.
