Customer Complaint Resolution When a customer complaint is received, it is logged by the customer service team (LogComplaint). The complaint is then assigned to a relevant team member (AssignTeamMember) who investigates the issue (InvestigateIssue). The team member proposes a resolution (ProposeResolution), which, upon customer acceptance, is implemented (ImplementResolution). The process concludes with a follow-up to ensure the customer is satisfied with the resolution (Follow-Up), and any lessons learned are documented for continuous improvement (DocumentLessonsLearned).
