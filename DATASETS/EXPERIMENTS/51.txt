When SufficientPersonnelRequirements, I ReportVacancy to personnel department.
Then, I WaitForJobDescription, before AdvertizingJob.
Under certain circumstances, I must AskForCorrections.
Otherwise, I ApproveJobDescription.
Sometimes, it also happen that the colleague from the human resources department AskQuestionsAboutTasksAndRequirements before he can DescribeTheJob.
In this case, I RemainAvailableForClarifications, of course.
