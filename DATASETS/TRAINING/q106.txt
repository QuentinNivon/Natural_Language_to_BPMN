The process starts with T0 and T1 in sequence and finishes with T14, T15, T16, T17, T18, T19, T20 in sequence.
In the middle, T11 is in parallel of T12 before T13, and in parallel of T2 before T3 before T9 in parallel of T4 preceding T5 preceding a loop.
The loop executes T6 and T7 in sequence and then T8.

ASSISTANT:

- (T0 < T1)
- (T14 < T15 < T16 < T17 < T18 < T19 < T20)
- (T0, T1) < (T11 & (T12 < T13) & (T2 < T3 < (T9 & (T4 < T5 < ((T6 < T7) < T8)*)))) < (T14, T15, T16, T17, T18, T19, T20)
