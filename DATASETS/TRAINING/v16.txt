This process starts with a choice between T6 and T0, T1, T2, T3, T4 and T5. The choice is followed by T7, T8 and T9 that must occur one after the other. Inside the choice, all the tasks are executed in sequence, except T5 that can be put in parallel of T2, T3 and T4.

ASSISTANT:

- T6 | (T0, T1, T2, T3, T4, T5)
- (T0, T1, T2, T3, T4, T5, T6) < (T7 < T8 < T9)
- T0 < T1 < T2 < T3 < T4
- (T2, T3, T4) & T5
