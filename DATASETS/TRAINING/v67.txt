First, the process executes T0 in parallel of T1 before T2 T5 and T3 before T4 in parallel, all before T6.
Then, T7 T8 and T9 execute in sequence, preceding T16 in parallel of T10, T11, T12 in sequence before a choice between T13 preceding T14 and T15.
Finally, T17 executes.

ASSISTANT:

- T0 & (T1 < (T2 & T5 & (T3 < T4)) < T6)
- (T0, T1, T2, T5, T3, T4, T6) < (T7 < T8 < T9) < (T16 & ((T10 < T11 < T12) < ((T13 < T14) | T15)))
- (T0, T1, T2, T5, T3, T4, T6, T7, T8, T9, T16, T10, T11, T12, T13, T14, T15) < T17
