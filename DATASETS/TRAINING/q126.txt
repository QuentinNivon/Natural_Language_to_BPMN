 The process starts with T0. After, we have in parallel T4 followed by T2, T1, T5, T3. After T1, T4, T2, T5, and T3, a choice starts, executing either
T6 or T7, T8 and T9 in parallel. After all these tasks, T12, T13, T14, T15, T17 and T18 execute in a row. After T15, T16 executes.

ASSISTANT:

- T0
- T0 < ((T4 < T2) & T1 & T5 & T3)
- (T1, T4, T2, T5, T3) < (T6 | (T7 & T8 & T9))
- (T1, T4, T2, T5, T3, T6, T7, T8, T9) < (T12 < T13 < T14 < T15 < T17 < T18)
- T15 < T16
