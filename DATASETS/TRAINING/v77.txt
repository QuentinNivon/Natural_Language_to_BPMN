Tasks T11, T10, T7 and T9 can be executed in parallel of all the others. T7 necessarily precedes T8. Either T0 followed by T1 followed by T2 is executed, or T3 is. T4 must occur before T6 and T5, but these tree can be iterated.

ASSISTANT:

- (T11, T10, T7, T9) & (T8, T0, T1, T2, T3, T4, T5, T6)
- T7 < T8
- (T0 < T1 < T2) | T3
- (T4 < (T6, T5))*
