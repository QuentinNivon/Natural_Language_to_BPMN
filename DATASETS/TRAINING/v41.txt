The workflow starts with T0.
Then, in parallel executes a branch composed of either T9 or T8 both followed by T10, and a branch composed of a choice between T1 T2 T3 in sequence and T4 T5 T6 T7 in sequence.
After them, T11 executes, prior to T14 before T15 in parallel of T12 before T13.

ASSISTANT:

- T0
- T0 < (((T9 | T8) < T10) & ((T1 < T2 < T3) | (T4 < T5 < T6 < T7)))
- (T0, T1, T2, T3, T4, T5, T6, T7, T8, T9, T10) < T11 < ((T14 < T15) & (T12 < T13))
