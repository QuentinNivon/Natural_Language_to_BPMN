T0 and T1 execute simultaneously, before T2 T3 and T4 in sequence.
After T4, a choice containing either T15, or T12, or T13 before T14 is in parallel of a sequence composed of T5, T6, T7 and T8 preceding T9 before T10 before T9 or T11.
Then, T16 precedes T17 and T18.

ASSISTANT:

- (T0 & T1) < (T1 < T2 < T4))
- T4 < ((T15 | T12 | (T13 < T14)) & ((T5 < T6 < T7 < T8) < (T9 < T10 < (T9 | T11)))
- (T0, T1, T2, T4, T15, T12, T13, T14, T5, T6, T7, T8, T9, T10, T11) < (T16 < (T17, T18))
