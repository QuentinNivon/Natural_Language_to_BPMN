This process starts with two parallel branches.
The first branch contains T0 before a choice composed of T1, T2, T3, T4, and T5, which precedes T6, which precedes T7 T8 and T9 in parallel.
The second branch contains T10 before T11, T12, T13, and T14.
After the parallel branches, T15 precedes T16 which precedes T19 in parallel of T17 before T18.

ASSISTANT:

- (T0 < (T1 | T2 | T3 | T4 | T5) < T6 < (T7 & T8 & T9)) & (T10 < (T11, T12, T13, T14))
- (T0, T1, T2, T3, T4, T5, T6, T7, T8, T9, T10, T11, T12, T13, T14) < (T15 < T16 < (T19 & (T17 < T18)))
