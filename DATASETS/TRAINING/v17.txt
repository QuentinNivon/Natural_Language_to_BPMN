T0 followed by T1 followed by T2 are in parallel of T3, T4 and T5 which are in sequence.
After them, T6 executes before T7 which executes before either T6 or T8.
Finally, T12 executes in parallel of T9 T10 and T11 in sequence.
After T11 and T12, T13 starts.

ASSISTANT:

- (T0 < T1 < T2) & (T3 < T4 < T5)
- (T0, T1, T2, T3, T4, T5) < (T6 < T7 < (T6 | T8))
- (T0, T1, T2, T3, T4, T5, T6, T7, T8) < (T12 & (T9 < T10 < T11))
- (T11, T12) < T13
