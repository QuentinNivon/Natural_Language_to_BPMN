The entire process is a parallel gateway, composed of four paths.
The first one and the second one contain respectively T16 and T15.
The third one executes T11 T12 T13 and T14 one after the other.
The last one starts T0 followed by either T25 or T1 T2 T3 T0 in sequence.
At the end of the last branch, T4 and T5 executes simultaneously, just before T6 and T7 in sequence, which are themselves before a choice between T10 and T8 T9 in sequence.

ASSISTANT:

- (T16) & (T15) & (T11 < T12 < T13 < T14) & (T0 < ((T1 < T2 < T3 < T0) | T25))
- (T0, T1, T2, T3, T25) < (T4 & T5) < (T6 < T7) < (T10 | (T8 < T9))
