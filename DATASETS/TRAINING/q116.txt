The process begins with a big parallel part containing T0, T1 followed by T2 followed by T3, and a choice.
In this choice, either T4, T9, T10, T7 followed by T8, or T5 followed by T6 execute.
Then, T11, T12, T13, T14, and T15 execute one after each other.
After T15, T16 and T17 execute.

ASSISTANT:

- T0 & (T1 < T2 < T3) & (T4 | T9 | T10 | (T7 < T8) | (T5 < T6))
- (T0, T1, T2, T3, T4, T5, T6, T7, T8, T9, T10) < (T11 < T12 < T13 < T14 < T15)
- T15 < (T16, T17)
