The process starts with a parallel gateway executing T3 T4 T5 in sequence, in parallel of T0 T1 T2 in sequence in parallel of T6.
Next, T7 T8 and T9 in parallel precede T10 T11 and T12 in parallel, themselves preceding a choice between T7 T8 T9 and T13 T14 T15 in sequence.

ASSISTANT:

- (T3 < T4 < T5) & (T0 < T1 < T2) & T6
- (T3, T4, T5, T0, T1, T2, T6) < ((T7 & T8 & T9) < (T10 & T11 & T12) < ((T7, T8, T9) | (T13 < T14 < T15)))
