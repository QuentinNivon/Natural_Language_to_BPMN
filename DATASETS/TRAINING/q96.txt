 I want a choice with either T6 followed by T7, T8 and T9 and T7 before T8, or T0, T1, T2 and T3 all in sequence, or
T4 before T5. After this choice, T10 starts, and when it finishes, another choice starts between T11, T12, T13 in sequence, and T14, T15, T16 in sequence.

ASSISTANT:

- (T6 < ((T7 < T8), T9)) | (T0 < T1 < T2 < T3) | (T4 < T5)
- (T6, T7, T8, T9, T0, T1, T2, T3, T4, T5) < T10 < ((T11 < T12 < T13) | (T14 < T15 < T16))
